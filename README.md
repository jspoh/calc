# calc
calculator with click UI

Painstakingly made this with pygame as I somehow hadn't heard of dedicated GUI builders such as PySimpleGUI, tkinter etc. 
Honestly can't believe how much easier and nicer I could have made this if I used PySimpleGUI instead of pygame. 

Might rewrite this with a proper GUI builder if I get bored :D
